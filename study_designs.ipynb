    "You are a health officer working in a small town (\"T\") with 1000 residents. You have received reports from the doctors in the area that there is a gastroenteritis like outbreak, characterised by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in the town. Your department head wants you to investigate this. What will be your first step and what will you do?\n",

    "## Case series\n",
    "- In a case series, all 'cases' of a disease are studied in detail\n",
    "- A case definition is set up to identify each case as it occurs\n",
    "- A population is defined and the cases are studied and each case is followed up\n",
    "- There is no comparison group\n",
    "- A case series is good for description but not useful for causal research\n",

    "You have now identified that there were 75 people who were affected with the gastroenteritis in your town, and you also found out by interviewing each of them that they had visited a newly opened cafe in the town that served a special meal.

    "- Relatively inexpensive in terms of time and expenses\n",

    "## Disadvantages of a cross-sectional survey\n",
    "- As you measure exposure and outcome at the same time, therefore\n",
    "- You cannot assess a causal association only on the basis of a cross-sectional survey\n",
    "- Risk of reverse causation, that the effect can lead to a 'cause'\n",
    "- Example: In a cross-sectional survey, salt intake can be found to be lower among those with high blood pressure\n",
    "- This can happen if those diagnosed with high blood pressure choose to consume less salt FOLLOWING their diagnosis but included in the survey\n",
